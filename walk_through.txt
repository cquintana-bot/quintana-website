This was my first-time programming with HTML and making a website. With the help of the professor and learning the tools I needed from google. I was able to say that I made a code through HTML that displays my website. First, I had to establish an Index file that was my main source of codes. My codes began with listing my content that I needed for my file. After that I had to establish a CSS file that basically called upon my Index file. This was the detail portion of how I wanted my document to look. With a few more adjustments and comment from the professor I was able to complete the webpage. 
Furthermore, I wish I had some time to understand how to manipulate the file code in order to have a better presentation. I wanted my skills sections to include a column so that it could fill the rest of the page. I also would have like to change my name that is display into blue giving it a more vibrant look. In the section of the about me portfolio I would have liked to put a video/ pictures of myself working on a house that I was remodeling. Finally, I would like to conclude and say that I enjoy this project because it gave me an competitive edge towards my competitors when applying for jobs.
