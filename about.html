		<h2> Construction</h2>
			<div class="summary">
				<p> Since 2012 I've been working in construction. I have always like to fix anything I could get my hands on. I am motivated by learning and adapting to the situation, the expression always on my toes is the best feeling to me. Any problem that comes your way can be analyzed assisted and fixed through different methods. I plan to continue my education in learning new construction with new ventures to come. Most of my projects are from work, for example, I have remodeled kitchens, bathrooms, basements, living rooms, garage, and even a whole house. For the past three years now I have been building decks. All the projects I have done gets me a step closer to building my dream house. </p>
